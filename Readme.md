# üçÄSFML Starter template

> Note: Tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11

This is the starter template and guide to set up SFML on Windows with MinGW and Visual Studio Code.<br>

We didn't find any useful articles or YouTube videos so we tried to set up the project on my own

## üèõÔ∏èTemplate Structure

### 1. Assets

In this folder, you put all your images animation, and sound.

### 2. build

In this folder all the build file and SFML dlls are stored you can execute the main exe from here.

### 3. headers

This folder contains sfml headers and user can create their own headers file too. but you need to make changes to the Makefile.

### 4. src

This is the source file where you write and structure your code.

### 5. main.cpp

Here, it is only the starter code you can link the source file from src.

### 6. run.bat

This file is used to build the project.

> You can also manually type the following command to build.

```bash
g++ -Iheaders/include -c main.cpp
```

```bash
g++ main.o -o build/main -Lheaders/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lopengl32 -lsfml-audio
```

```cpp
.\main
```

## üõ†Ô∏èInstallation and setup

### 1. Visual Studio Code

Download and install Visual Studio Code from [ code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install the C/C++ extension.

### 2. MinGW

Download and install MinGW from [mingw-w64.org](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) or [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) (We recommend msys2 as it makes things a lot easier). You can find on msys2 website to install it.

### 3. SFML

Download sfml from [sfml-dev.org](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.0/) website and MinGW. You can choose 32-bit or 64-bit version depending upon your platform.

Now structure the file system as below and you are good to go.
